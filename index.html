  I am a senior in Towers Highschool. I'm a very silent person, I don't really like to talk, and i'm pretty much known by no one. I love science because it is
    a very interesting subject. I also like video games, anime, computer science. I also play an instrument, a snare drum, I'm new to it but I learn and understand
    things quickly, so I already gotten better within a few days. I also goimg to college, havn't decided which college yet, to become a video game programmer.
