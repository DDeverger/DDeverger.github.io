       Who forged the first katana? Well according to legend, a Japanese swordsmith named Amakuni forged the first katana in 700 AD. The story begins when his emperor gave him an dissatisfied look. After that he turned his attention to the swords of the emperor's soldiers and noticed that all of their swords were broken or damaged, after realizing that he had a goal to forge an unbreakable sword. So he and his son locked themselves in their forge and prayed for seven days and nights, and after that their journey to forge an unbreakable sword began. They selected the best iron sand ore to create Tamagahame and refind it into steel. They worked on this sword for 31 days without rest. They were exhuasted,they had assistant swordsmith sharpen and polish the sword. After that the first katana was born, and the emperor's army had unbreakable swords. In the end Amakuni was granted the title "The Legendary Swordsmith".
