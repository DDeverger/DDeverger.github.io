     <h1>What makes the Katana STAND OUT from other Swords</h1>
     <h2>Its curved blade</h2>
     <p>The blade of the katana has an odd shape from other swords, because its curved. Why is the katana blade curved? This is because the blade's design is to form a "slicing motion", which makes strikes from the katana quicker and more lethal.</p>
     <h2>Its light weight</h2>
     <p>The katana is the only sword that uses the least amount of steel making this sword the lightest sword ever created and it allows the user to have more fast and powerful slashes.</p>
     <h2>Its two hand grip</h2>
     <p>The grip or tsuka can be held with two hands, which sounds like it doesn't really contribute to anything, but it really does. Using a sword with two hands is better than using a sword with one hand. When you use two hands with the katana you apply more force behind your swing. Combine this with the speed and weight with the katana to created an extremely lethal strike.</p>
